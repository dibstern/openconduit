[![CI](https://github.com/dibstern/conduit/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dibstern/conduit/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/conduit-code)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/conduit-code) [![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dw/conduit-code)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/conduit-code) [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/dibstern/conduit)](https://github.com/dibstern/conduit) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://github.com/dibstern/conduit/blob/main/LICENSE)

Conduit connects to `opencode serve` and streams your session to a browser.
Phone, tablet, desktop — anything on your local network. Scan the QR code. Done.

The part worth setting up for: when OpenCode needs permission to run something,
you get a push notification. Tap Allow. OpenCode continues. You don't need to
be at your desk.

---

## Getting started

```bash
# Requires: opencode serve (running on port 4096)
npx conduit-code
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/GENERATE-SETUP.gif"
       alt="Conduit first-run setup wizard with QR code" width="220">
</p>

First run opens a setup wizard: set a port and PIN, optionally enable HTTPS,
scan the QR code with your phone. About two minutes.

For access beyond your local network, [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) is
the cleanest option — encrypted tunnel, no port forwarding, free for personal
use.

---

## Approve from your phone

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/GENERATE-APPROVAL.png"
       alt="OpenCode tool permission approval notification on iPhone" width="220">
</p>

OpenCode pauses on every tool permission request. Conduit sends a push
notification — tap **Allow** or **Deny** from wherever you are.

Open browser tabs get a blinking favicon and title change. Sound alerts are
optional.

---

## Full OpenCode UI in any browser

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/GENERATE-SPLIT.gif"
       alt="Conduit split-screen: OpenCode session alongside a browser preview" width="520">
</p>

Chat history, tool output with diff rendering, file browser with live reload,
xterm.js terminal tabs, session forking, slash command autocomplete, todo
progress overlay. The complete interface — on a phone screen or a 4K monitor.

OpenCode's agent and model selectors are in the header. Mermaid diagrams render
as diagrams. Code blocks have syntax highlighting and copy buttons.

---

## One daemon, every project

```bash
cd ~/backend  && npx conduit-code    # registers project
cd ~/frontend && npx conduit-code    # adds to same daemon
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="media/GENERATE-DASHBOARD.png"
       alt="Conduit project dashboard listing multiple OpenCode sessions" width="520">
</p>

One port, all projects. Switch between registered sessions from the browser.
The daemon stays running after the terminal closes — sessions survive.

<details>
<summary>Detailed comparisons</summary>

**Why not tmux + Termius?**
No push notifications. No way to approve OpenCode permissions without switching
back to the terminal. Raw terminal on a phone is painful to navigate.

**Why not adding notification hooks?**
Hooks with ntfy or Pushover get you alerts, but when the notification arrives
there's no approval UI — you're back in a terminal. Conduit gives you the
notification and the one-tap response in the same place.

**Why not ngrok or a tunnel service?**
Third-party servers see your traffic. Conduit stays on your local network
or Tailscale — nothing routes through an external service.

**Why not SSH + terminal on mobile?**
Raw terminal, no approval UI, no push notifications, no mobile-optimised
interface. You end up checking manually instead of getting notified.

**What about OpenCode's built-in web UI?**
OpenCode ships a web interface via `opencode web` that covers the core
experience well — sessions, model switching, multi-project with a project
picker, terminal attachment — and works with any model.

Where Conduit adds to the experience: push notifications, one-tap permission
approvals, and PWA install. On authentication, `opencode web` uses HTTP Basic
Auth — with a strong password this means re-entering credentials on every
visit, which gets tedious on mobile. Conduit uses a numeric PIN entered once
at startup, then stays authenticated. If you mostly work at your desk and
want a browser view, `opencode web` may be all you need.

**What about Clay (claude-relay)?**
Conduit exists because of [Clay](https://github.com/chadbyte/clay). I loved
what Clay did for Claude Code — a browser UI on any device, push
notifications, mobile approvals — and wanted the same experience for
[OpenCode](https://opencode.ai), where I could use any model and provider.
Much of Conduit's original implementation was built on Clay's approach, and
that foundation made this project possible.

Where the two diverge: Clay embeds the Claude Agent SDK and drives Claude Code
directly, while Conduit is a relay for `opencode serve`. If you use Claude
Code, Clay is the project you want. If you use OpenCode, Conduit brings that
same vision to your setup. I do plan, however, to add support for Claude Code
now that opencode doesn't officially support Claude subscription accounts
using OAuth.

**Server**

- Multi-project support — single port, all registered projects
- PIN authentication (4–8 digits)
- HTTPS with auto-generated certificates via mkcert
- Keep-awake mode — prevents macOS sleep while sessions are active

</details>

---

## Push notifications (HTTPS setup)

Push requires HTTPS. One-time setup:

```bash
brew install mkcert && mkcert -install
```

Conduit generates certificates automatically on first run. The wizard
handles the rest. If push registration fails, check that your browser trusts
the certificate and that your phone can reach the address.

---

## Security

Conduit binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. Set `HOST=0.0.0.0` to expose on
your LAN. **Set a PIN.** Anyone on your network with the URL and PIN can access
your OpenCode session.

Do not expose this to the public internet. For remote access, use
[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) or a VPN.

---

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>Common questions</summary>

**"Does my code leave my machine?"**
No. Conduit runs locally and relays between your browser and `opencode serve`.
Files stay on your machine. Only OpenCode's own API calls go out, same as the CLI.

**"Is this a terminal wrapper?"**
No. Conduit connects to OpenCode's HTTP/SSE API directly. It doesn't scrape
or parse terminal output.

**"Can I continue a CLI session in the browser?"**
Yes. Conduit picks up existing sessions from `opencode serve`. Switch between
the terminal and browser freely.

**"Does it work with my existing OpenCode config?"**
Yes. Agents, models, MCP servers, and project-level configuration all carry
over as-is.

**"Do I need mkcert for basic use?"**
No. Conduit works over plain HTTP on localhost. mkcert is only needed for
HTTPS, which is required for push notifications and LAN access.

**"What happens if the daemon crashes?"**
Sessions are owned by OpenCode (SQLite), not Conduit. Restart the daemon and
your sessions are still there. Conduit includes a crash counter that prevents
restart loops.

## Architecture

```

Conduit is a stateless translation layer. OpenCode owns all state (SQLite).
The relay handles WebSocket lifecycle, event translation, PIN authentication,
TLS termination, and Web Push delivery.
